  Alright. We have greeted the world. Now what? Math? Clojure is great at math. Thanks
  to the uniformity of prefix notation, we don't have to worry about precedence rules;
  which we kinda loathe anyway. This goes before that, and that goes before that other 
  thing... blah! In Clojure, mathematical operators work like any other function. The
  common operators are +, -, *, and /. Let's try them out:
</p>

<p><code>(+ 2 2)</code></p>
<p><code>(- 3 2)</code></p>
<p><code>(* 5 5)</code></p>
<p><code>(/ 4 3)</code></p>

<p>
  So, that was great. But that last one doesn't quite look right. The problem is that Clojure
  has a built-in Ratio type. You can confirm this by doing this: <code>(class (/ 4 3))</code>.
</p>

<p>
  So how do we perform division that we are familiar with? If you want decimal division, use
  a floating-point literal for either the numerator or denominator:
  <code>(/ 4.0 3)</code>. If you want to stick to integer math, you can use the 
  <code>quot</code> function, or the <code>rem</code> function to get the remainder.
</p>

<p>
  All of the math functions take an arbitrary number of arguments. This means you can do stuff
  like this: <code>(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)</code>. Go ahead, try it out. You know you want to. Play 
  around with the math functions for a while. I'll wait. Go ahead.
</p>

<p>
  That's the end of step two. Type next to continue to step three, where we'll play with 
  sequences.
