  Let's jump right in there and write some Clojure. Let's start out with the familiar
  'Hello, World!'. People seem to love it so much. Type the following into the REPL:
</p>

<code class="expr">(println "!dlrow ,olleH")</code>

<p>
  Something isn't right here! (I'm not talking about the fact that this website's lack of panache).
  It seems that 'Hello World' has been mangled! It's okay though, because we're smart and we can 
  figure out how to remedy this situation. If you're wondering why it printed our gibberish AND
  'nil' it's because 'nil' (which essentially means 'nothing') is println's return value. Let's
  experiment until we figure out what went wrong. It seems that the <code>reverse</code>
  should fix things -- so type the following into the REPL:
</p>

<code class="expr">(reverse "!dlrow ,olleH")</code>

<p>
  Hmm. It did indeed set it right, but this isn't what we were looking for! That doesn't even look
  like a string. Reverse took our string, reversed it, and now we have a sequence of characters.
  You can tell this because each character has a '\\' (backslash in layman's terms) preceeding it.
  Clojure uses those to denote Character (big 'C' character) literals. We need a string though!
  What do we do when we need a string, but we have something else that isn't stringy (a highly
  technical term)? No, we don't go to the shop and buy string cheese (not to disparage string
  cheese mind you), but instead we use the lovely <code>str</code> function! Try this:
</p>

<code class="expr">(str (reverse "!dlrow ,olleH"))</code>

<p>
  Ooh! So close. It appears that the str function is making the entire sequence a string!
  Sequences can be made to look like strings. str works on any number of arguments. You can pass
  str any number of arguments and it will call Java's toString method on each of them to change
  them into a string, and then it will concatenate them all into one mammoth string. Unfortunately,
  all of our characters are stuck in this sequence! How can we get them out of the sequence, and
  pass them all to str? Do not fear, young Clojurian, for I have the answer. We use the 
  <code>apply</code> function. <code>apply</code> takes a function and a sequence, and 'unrolls'
  the sequence, passing all of its elements to the function as arguments. Basically, it takes the
  sequence and dumps its elements into the argument list of the supplied function; which is exactly
  what we need. Let's see if it works... Try this:
</p>

<code class="expr">(apply str (reverse "!dlrow ,olleH"))</code>

<p>
  Ka-chow! There we go. Impressive. I'm proud of you, I really am. Now, for the final test. Let's
  tell the world just how much they mean to us by making the world rotate in the other direction!
  Let's do this:
</p>

<code class="expr">(println (apply str (reverse "!dlrow ,olleH")))</code>

<p>
  Congratulations, you have passed step one. Press Next to continue.
