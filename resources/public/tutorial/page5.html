<p>
  We've learned a little about Clojure's sequences, so let's use them to do some stuff. I've been
  wondering how vowels are in the word "teddybear". Aren't you wondering the same thing? It's 
  absolutely agonizing not knowing! We're programmers, you and I, so we shouldn't have to count
  those vowels ourselves. Indeed, we don't. We can use Clojure to count them for us!
</p>

<p>
  Okay, we'll start with the string "teddybear". We're going to be using this string a lot, and we
  don't want to have to keep typing it over and over again, do we? Luckily, Clojure can  help us here.
  Type this into the REPL: <code>(def teddy "teddybear")</code>. What def does is pretty 
  simple: it simply gives a name to a value so that we can refer to it by that name later. Dont' worry 
  about what the REPL printed when you typed that, it's just trying to show you exactly where the var is
  mapped (in this case, a sandbox generated namespace). We need to make sure it worked. Type this 
  into the REPL: <code>teddy</code>. Cool huh?
</p>

<p>
  Now that we are armed with a loaded teddybear, we can start figuring out how to find out the number
  of vowels. For this, we need to introduce a new collection type: sets. A literal set looks like this:
  <code>#{3 4 5 "x" \y}</code>. A set can hold anything, but it can't hold any two of the same
  thing. In a set, there can be no duplicate objects. Another important fact about sets is that they, like
  maps, are also functions. A set is a function that takes an argument and looks inside itself to see
  if that same object is inside of it. If this is true, it returns the object, or returns nil. Let's
  try this out for ourselves:
</p>

<p><code>(#{1 2 3} 3)</code></p>
<p><code>(#{"abc" \e} \e)</code></p>
<p><code>(#{3 4 \x} 5)</code></p>

<p>
  Okay, so how is this useful? It really isn't. Not alone, anyway. However, when it's combined with 
  other sequence functions, it can be used to make a really elegant solution to a problem like this.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, so we have a way to test if a character is a vowel. We can simply do this:
  <code>(#{\a \e \i \o \u} \e)</code>. Since we're going to be using the set of vowels a lot, 
  go ahead and give it a name in the REPL: <code>(def vowels #{\a \e \i \o \u})</code>. Now we 
  can use <code>vowels</code> to refer to the set of vowels.
</p>

<p>
  Now, we have a way to find out if a character is a vowel, now we just need a way to remove 
  everything that isn't a vowel from our teddybear string. I have just the function! We need
  <code>filter</code>. Filter takes what is called a 'predicate', that is, a function that returns 
  true or false, and it applies this function to each element of a sequence in turn. If the predicate
  function returns false or nil for an element, that element is removed from the sequence. If the 
  predicate function returns anything that isn't false or nil for an element, that element is left
  alone. In Clojure, anything that isn't false or nil is considered a true value.
</p>

<p>
  Let's try filter out a bit. Let's try to filter out all odd numbers from a sequence of numbers. 
  Clojure has a function called <code>odd?</code> that we can use. Putting a question mark at the end
  is a Clojure naming convention for functions that are predicates (return either true or false). Try it
  out in the REPL:
</p>

<p><code>(odd? 1)</code></p>
<p><code>(odd? 2)</code></p>

<p>
  Okay, now we need a sequence of numbers. We could type these out by hand, but that's tedious, and as
  Clojure programmers, we do not tolerate 'tedious'. We can use Clojure's range function to generate 
  these numbers for us. <code>range</code>, if given one integer, will generate a sequence of numbers
  from 0 to the integer that you passed to it. Try this: <code>(range 10)</code>. We have a 
  sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. Apparently, the upper-bound (the number you passed to range) is 
  'exclusive', meaning it's not included in the resulting range. If we really wanted a sequence of 
  numbers from 0 to 10, we'd do this: <code>(range 11)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  We don't really want the zero, so let's give range a lower-bound, along with an upper-bound. It can
  take two arguments: <code>(range 1 11)</code>. There we go! We have all of the numbers from 
  1 to 10. Now, let's use filter and the odd? function to get all of the odd numbers out of the sequence. 
  Try this: <code>(filter odd? (range 1 11))</code>. Ka-chow! That's magic, isn't it? Work of 
  art, that is.
</p>

<p>
  Now that we know how to use filter, we can now use it to filter out all of the vowels in our teddy
  string. We have our string defined in teddy, and our set of vowels in vowels, so we should try this:
  <code>(filter vowels teddy)</code>. That was easy enough. Now we have a sequence of 
  characters. But we still need to count them! Luckily, Clojure has just the function for that: 
  <code>count</code>! It takes a sequence and counts (whoda thunk it) the number of elements in the 
  sequence. Let's try it out: <code>(count (filter vowels teddy))</code>. Yeehaw! You did it! 
  Once again, you never cease to amaze me. You're catching on quickly.

<p>
  That's the end of step 4. Type next to move on.
