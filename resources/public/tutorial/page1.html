  I am in the process of rewriting this tutorial and, of course, adding content. This tutorial
  was thrown together rather quickly and hasn't been touched in quite some time. I ask for
  patience while I get everything working smoothly. I have a lot going on in my life including
  a book and a new job. Furthermore, I don't even really know Javascript, so anything JavaScript
  related moves extremely slowly. Working on that. ;)

  This tutorial is intended for people who have never used Clojure before but have experience
  with other programming languages. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial, but instead
  intended to get you started with Clojure -- and hopefully interested enough to continue.
  Please bear in mind that this tutorial is evolving, so check back frequently for new additions.

  Above, you have your REPL. Please try the examples as we go along, and by all means experiment
  with concepts independently. Should you refuse, you will promptly be IP banned from this
  website, and a teddy bear will eat your candies. ;-)

  Don't make teddy eat your candy.

  All of the examples (pretty colored text) are clickable. If you click them, they will be copied
  into the REPL prompt above. This is for convenience, so you don't have to type tedious things
  like a backwards string (you'll see). Copy and pasting is not allowed in the REPL, because I and
  the creator of JQuery-console, which powers the REPL above, believe that copying and pasting isn't
  so great for learning. While these examples are clickable, I urge you to type out the examples by
  hand. If you type them out, they will sink in better. Enjoy the tutorial.

  You can type 'next' to move forward and 'back' to go back to the previous step.

<p>
  Type 'next' in the REPL to continue!
