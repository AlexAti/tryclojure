  I am in the process of rewriting this tutorial and, of course, adding content. The old tutorial
  was thrown together rather quickly and wasn't touched afterwards. I ask for
  patience while I get everything working smoothly. I have a lot going on in my life including
  a book and an upcoming new job. Furthermore, I don't even really know Javascript, so anything JavaScript
  related moves extremely slowly. Working on that. ;)

  Above, you have your REPL. Please try the examples as we go along, and by all means experiment
  with concepts independently. Should you refuse, you will promptly be IP banned from this
  website, and a teddy bear will eat your candies. ctrl+v to paste and ctrl+c to copy like you
  would normally expect, but you can't paste with your browser's right-click menu.

  You can type 'next' to move forward, 'back' to go back to the previous step, and 'restart' to
  restart the tutorial. Go ahead and type 'next' to begin
